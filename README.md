# ðŸ¤— Hugging Face packaging using GitHub Container Registry

[![CI](https://github.com/yrangana/huggingface-ghcr/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yrangana/huggingface-ghcr/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Learn how to create a container and package it with GitHub Actions. This repository gives you a good starting point for a Dockerfile, GitHub Actions workflow, and Python code.

The web application uses FastAPI with Hugging Face and exposes a single endpoint that you can interact with it. 

Fork this repository and run the GitHub Actions as-is so that you can register your own containerized application with no modifications needed.
